FWS-Endangered-Species-PDA
Python Data Analysis Project on FWS Endangered Species List

Problem Description:
The earth is currently experiencing its 6th mass extinction. During the past five, Ninety-nine percent of all species that have ever lived have gone extinct. Now, the rate of extinction is occurring 1,000 to 10,000 times faster. (Cho)
This crisis, unlike past extinctions can be linked to climate change, land use change, invasive species introduction, pollution, and resource exploitation. To protect the further loss of species, the ESA was passed in 1973 which was meant to help imperiled species recover from the brink of extinction. But the species protections and regulations have been weakened due to industrial and economic pressures. (Bleau)

Although its difficult to accurately put a cost on the loss of species, the global value of ecosystem services was estimated to average $46 trillion per year in 2007 according to Costanza et al. With this estimate, the cost of lost species is likely even higher today. 

Data Science Project Scoping: 
The focus of this project is the Global mass exctinction crisis and species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). I will be using data from the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) which will include listed species under the ESA, species of concern, listed species with recovery plans, and the FY 2017 and FY 2018 expenditures. In the future I would like to compare expenditures from additional years to see if there is a trend in the data, but 2018 was the most recent expenditures available on the FWS site.  




Who or what is affected by this problem?
Everyone
Ecosystems
Industries and financial markets

Why is solving this problem a priority?
Financial cost/value of provided services
Protection of ecosystem services
Protection from our own extinction
	
What other groups/stakeholders need to be involved in scoping and implementing this project?
Policy makers
Corporations (corporate accountability)
consumers

Goals:
Highlight discrepancies between highly - funded and less-funded/non-funded species (equity)
Highlight need for ESA funding (effectiveness)
Highlight the cost of extinction (efficiency)

Actions:
EDA of categorical variables (group, listing status, )
Look at distributions
EDA of numerical variables (compare fws / total spending per group, compare  fws / total spending between top funded and least funded. 
Do the top funded have anything in common?
Other ideas: 
maybe highlight how many species are petitioned/ how long they have been on waiting list
How many years has (subset of species) been listed? (effectiveness of listing/protection) 
Data analysis:
What is the estimated cost of ecosystem services? 
Is there a correlation between species budget and recovery plans?
Correlation between budget and number of recovery actions?
